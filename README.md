Spotify RAG Music Recommendation System
**Introduction**
The Spotify RAG Music Recommendation System is a sophisticated application designed to provide personalized music recommendations to users. Built using LangFlow, the system leverages the power of LangChain for seamless interaction with large language models (LLMs) and the Spotify API for accessing a vast library of music.
**Features**
Personalized Recommendations: Delivers tailored and formatted music suggestions based on user queries.
Real-Time Updates: Provides up-to-date music recommendations by querying the latest data from Spotify.
**Components**
**Data Retrieval**
The data retrieval component interfaces with the Spotify API to retrieves playlist data, which includes metadata for each song such as the title, artist, album, and audio features (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability).
**Textual Description Generation**
Once the song data is retrieved, the system uses LLMs to generate textual descriptions based on the audio features of each song. This step involves:
Analyzing Audio Features: Extracting key attributes of the song such as tempo, energy, danceability, and mood.
Generating Descriptions: Using these attributes to create a detailed textual description of each song. For instance, a high-energy song with a fast tempo might be described as an "upbeat and energetic track perfect for workouts."
**Data Storage**
The generated textual descriptions are stored in Astra DB, a database is used to efficiently manage and query the large volume of song descriptions.
**Query Processing**
Users can query the system for music recommendations based on their preferences. The query processing component involves:
Receiving User Queries: Taking input from the user regarding their music preferences (e.g., mood, activity, favorite genres).
Retrieving Relevant Descriptions: Using the descriptions in Astra DB to find songs that match the user's preferences.
Generating Recommendations: Presenting a formatted recommendation to the user based on their initial query(e.g., a query about a genric mood/genre would output a playlist)
